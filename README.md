# Airbnb Project Testing

Project data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata
1st step is loading the data into a python editor (PyCharm) and transforming the columns that have reduntant information.
2nd step is filling NaN values that can be retrieved so that we have a more complete data set.
3rd step is setting up the data types of columns in our data set so that we can import them later for visualization.
Finally importing our set on Tableau as .csv (Airbnb_Transformed_Data).
